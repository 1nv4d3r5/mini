*This is an in-development project, in a very early stage! Please keep that in mind. The release of this thing might
be in early 2014.*

# PHP-MVC

A simple and easy to understand MVC skeleton application, reduced to the max.
Everything is as simple as possible, as readable as possible and as manually as possible.
This project tries to be the extremely slimmed down opposite of big frameworks like Zend2, Symfony or Laravel.

## Why does this project exist ?

One of the biggest question in the PHP world is "How do I build an application ?".
It's hard to find a good base, a good file structure and useful information on that, but at the same time
there are masses of frameworks that might be really good, but hard to understand, hard to use and extremely complex.
This project tries to be some kind of naked skeleton bare-bone for quick application building, especially for the
not-so-advanced coder.

### This project tries to promote clean and modern PHP coding, by

- fitting PSR 1/2 coding guidelines
- usage of PDO
- promoting the usage of Composer, in the exactly the way it should be used
- more or less clean folder/file structure
- promoting developing with max. error reporting
