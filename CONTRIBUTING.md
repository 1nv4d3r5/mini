# How to contribute

## Pull Requests

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the php-mvc repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo#pull-requests) from each feature branch to
the **develop** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a pull
request for each branch. This allows the project owner to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

# How (NOT) to contribute

1. Please CHECK YOUR CODE and test your code before committing! Some people commit stuff that breaks
the project completely, and obviously they never even tried to run their own code.
2. Please ALWAYS commit into develop branch.
3. Please comment everything you do, everything you change! Comment the parameters, their contents and write
valid phpDocumentor blocks! If your code does not clearly say what it does, then it's not possible to accept it.

Thanks a lot for all your work!
