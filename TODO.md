# TODO

### Full documentation on how to use this
### Full documentation on how this works (graphics !)

"As manually as possible, as simple as possible. No automation when not needed."

### Autoloader for models
### "Autoloader" for header/footer
### Always open only one database connection (inject into model)
### Loading two models
### Composer tutorial
### Add SQL statement file
### Folder protection
### fix utf8 settings in SQL file

# Advanced TODO:

### Perfect code (?), rewrite code so PHPStorm notices disappear
### Paths: Use constants, directory separators etc.

# Ideas

1. basic version and advanced version ?

Basic version could be totally manually and reduced (manual require() of models and views),
advanced could automate things

# Code styles

### PSR 0/1/2/3
### Modern PHP does not use closing tags
